# How to Use These Prompts
- The extension orchestrator fills placeholders (e.g., {{db_engine}}, {{schema_snapshot_subset}}) and sends tasks to the right agent.
- Enforce strict JSON/YAML output to make the UI predictable (diffs, previews, rollbacks).
- Log each agent's inputs/outputs for auditability.
